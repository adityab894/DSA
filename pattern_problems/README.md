# Pattern-Based LeetCode Problems

Here’s the list I wish someone gave me earlier — so you don’t waste time like I did.

This collection focuses on **patterns**, not random problem solving.
If you master these, most interview problems will feel familiar.

## How to Use This List
- Solve **pattern-wise**, not problem-wise
- Identify the underlying technique
- Revisit this list before interviews
